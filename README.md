Installation & Setup
To get started with DeepView, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/prachirathi07/neural-network-visualizer.git
cd neural-network-visualizer
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries and dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. The following libraries are used in the project:

TensorFlow: For creating and handling the neural network models.
D3.js: For interactive visualizations.
Flask: For the backend, ensuring smooth API integration.
3. Run the Application
Start the server to launch the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will start locally on http://localhost:5000. You can now access the real-time visualization tool via your browser.

Usage
Once the server is running, you can:

Upload Your Neural Network Models: Upload models built in TensorFlow to visualize their architecture.
Explore Layers: Interactively view each layer of the neural network, including weights, activations, and connections.
Monitor Data Flow: Observe how data flows through the network from the input layer to the output, gaining insights into the transformation process at each step.
Adjust Parameters: Experiment with different network parameters and observe the real-time impact on model structure.
Technologies Used
Python: The core language for backend and processing.
TensorFlow: For model creation and manipulation.
D3.js: To create dynamic and responsive visualizations of the network architecture.
Flask: Lightweight web framework used to build the backend for serving data to the frontend.
Future Enhancements
Model Comparison: Add functionality for comparing multiple neural network architectures side by side.
Training Visualizations: Introduce live training metrics visualization, such as loss and accuracy over time, to monitor training performance in real time.
Support for More Frameworks: Extend support to other deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Keras for wider compatibility.
