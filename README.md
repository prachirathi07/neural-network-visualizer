## 🖥️ Neural Network Visualizer (DeepView)
📖 Overview
DeepView is a real-time interactive visualization tool that allows users to explore the inner workings of deep learning models. The tool provides a detailed view of neural network architectures, enabling users to understand how layers, nodes, and data flow are structured within models. It is designed for AI researchers, students, and data scientists who seek a deeper understanding of their models.

### 💡 Problem Statement
Neural networks are often referred to as "black boxes" due to their complexity, making it difficult to understand how they function. DeepView aims to solve this by offering an interactive and scalable visualization platform that allows users to observe the architecture of deep learning models in real-time.

### ✨ Features
