# Neural Network Visualizer

This project is a web application built with React to visualize and simulate neural networks.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page reloads when you make changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing it for the best performance.

### Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the application code.
  - **components**: Reusable UI components.
  - **config**: Configuration files.
  - **utils**: Utility functions for the application.

### Features

- Define neural network architecture (layers, neurons, activation functions).
- Visual animations for forward and backward propagation.
- Dynamic graphs to track training performance (loss and accuracy).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

### Usage

1. Run `npm start` to launch the application.
2. Upload your dataset and configure the neural network parameters.
3. Train the model and visualize forward/backward propagation.
